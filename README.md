# Express-Yourself

A note taker app developed to learn how to configure an Express.js application capable of handling GET requests, POST reuqests and server static HTML files.

While coding this app I gained experience creating HTML routes, API routes and utilized the Express fs module to store and retrieve notes to a JSON file.
